<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;">1. Structured Programming</span></h2>
<div class="article-container">
<p style="text-align: justify;">The structured programming has always been the point of comparison for the object-oriented programming. This is due to the fact that most low-level languages have always used this form of programming that, by default, tend to be much more advantageous on issues related to performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main difference between structured programming and OOP is the way the code is written and processed. In structured programming, all methods are written globally and run sequentially. The code lines are processed one by one. Thus we have an undeviating code, unlike what happens in object-oriented programming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the use of objects, OOP works more dynamically, making calls according to the need of the code for a certain time and prioritizing the reuse of the source code and productivity.</p>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #339966;">2. Object-oriented programming</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, object-oriented programming is more widespread due to the production gains in large scale. Development companies choose to use it because of benefits as, for example, productivity gain. However, the structured language is not totally ruled out as its advantages for performance end up compensating when it comes to softwares to hardwares that need a much higher performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opting for either programming format will depend exclusively on the type of demand; the definitions choose the best way. As the possibilities in both formats are very broad, it is necessary to conduct a wide analysis, especially if the structured programming is an option. In the development market there are very few professionals who turn to structured programming. So setting up a project based on it demands not only developers to the project itself, but also for the maintenance of the system afterwards.</p>
