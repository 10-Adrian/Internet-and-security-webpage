<p><strong>Internet security:</strong></p>
<p>- Difference between passive and active ecurity threats</p>
<h3>Definition of Passive Attacks</h3>
<p><strong>Passive attacks</strong>&nbsp;are the attacks where the attacker indulges in unauthorized eavesdropping, just monitoring the transmission or gathering information. The eavesdropper does not make any changes to the data or the system.</p>
<p>Unlike active attack, the passive attack is hard to detect because it doesn&rsquo;t involve any alteration in the data or system resources. Thus, the attacked entity doesn&rsquo;t get any clue about the attack. Although, it can be prevented using encryption methods in which the data is firstly encoded in the unintelligible language at the sender&rsquo;s end and then at the receivers end it is again converted into human understandable language.In this way, at the time of transit, the message is in an unintelligible form which could not be understood by the hackers. That is the reason, in passive attacks, the prevention has more concern than detection. The passive attacks entangle the open ports that are not protected by firewalls. The attacker continuously searches for the vulnerabilities and once it is found the attacker gains access to network and system.</p>
<div class="google-auto-placed ap_container">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The passive attacks are further classified into two types, first is the release of message content and second is traffic analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>release of message content</strong>&nbsp;can be expressed with an example, in which the sender wants to send a confidential message or email to the receiver. The sender doesn&rsquo;t want the contents of that message to be read by some interceptor.</li>
<li>By using encryption a message could be masked in order to prevent the extraction of the information from the message, even if the message is captured. Though still attacker can analyse the traffic and observe the pattern to retrieve the information. This type of passive attack refers to as&nbsp;<strong>traffic analysis</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<div id="techd">
<h2>Key Differences&nbsp;</h2>
<ol>
<li>The active attack includes&nbsp;<strong>modification</strong>&nbsp;of the message. On the other hand, in passive attacks, the attacker doesn&rsquo;t commit any changes to the intercepted information.</li>
<li>The active attack causes a huge amount of harm to the system while the passive attack doesn&rsquo;t cause any harm to the system resources.</li>
<li>A passive attack is considered as a threat to data confidentiality. In contrast, an active attack is a threat to the integrity and availability of the data.</li>
<li>The attacked entity is aware of the attack in case of active attack. As against, the victim is unaware of the attack in the passive attack.</li>
<li>The active attack is accomplished by gaining the physical control over the communication link to capture and insert transmission. On the contrary, in a passive attack, the attacker just needs to observe the transmission.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The active and passive attacks can be differentiated on the basis of what are they, how they are performed and how much extent of damage they cause to the system resources. But, majorly the active attack modifies the information and causes a lot of damage to the system resources and can affect its operation. Conversely, the passive attack does not make any changes to the system resources and therefore doesn&rsquo;t causes any damage.</p>

<p><strong>Malware</strong></p>
<p>"Malware"&nbsp;is short for malicious software and used as a single term to refer to virus, spy ware, worm etc. Malware is designed to cause damage to a stand-alone computer or a networked pc. So wherever a malware term is used it means a program which is designed to damage your computer it may be a virus, worm or Trojan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Virus</strong></p>
<p>Virus is a program written to enter to your computer and damage/alter your files/data. A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer. Viruses can also replicate themselves. A computer Virus is more dangerous than a computer worm as it makes changes or deletes your files while worms only replicates itself with out making changes to your files/data.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of virus are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>W32.Sfc!mod<br />ABAP.Rivpas.A<br />Accept.3773</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viruses can enter to your computer as an attachment of images, greeting, or audio / video files. Viruses also enters through downloads on the Internet. They can be hidden in a free/trial softwares or other files that you download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So before you download anything from the internet, be sure about it first. Almost all viruses are attached to an executable file, which means the virus may exist on your computer but it actually cannot infect your computer unless you run or open the malicious program. It is important to note that a virus cannot be spread without a human action, such as running an infected program to keep it going.</p>

<p><strong>Trojans</strong></p>
<p>A Trojan horse is not a virus. It is a destructive program that looks as a genuine application. Unlike viruses, Trojan horses do not replicate themselves but they can be just as destructive. Trojans also open a backdoor entry to your computer which gives malicious users/programs access to your system, allowing confidential and personal information to be theft.</p>
<p>Example: - JS.Debeski.Trojan</p>
<p>Trojan horses are broken down in classification based on how they infect the systems and the damage caused by them. The seven main types of Trojan horses are:</p>
<p>&bull; Remote Access Trojans&nbsp;<br />&bull; Data Sending Trojans&nbsp;<br />&bull; Destructive Trojans&nbsp;<br />&bull; Proxy Trojans&nbsp;<br />&bull; FTP Trojans&nbsp;<br />&bull; Security software disabler Trojans&nbsp;<br />&bull; Denial-of-service attack Trojans</p>

<p><strong>Worms</strong></p>
<p>Worms are malicious programs that make copies of themselves again and again on the local drive, network shares, etc. The only purpose of the worm is to reproduce itself again and again. It doesn&rsquo;t harm any data/file on the computer. Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems</p>
<p>Examples of worm are:</p>
<p>W32.SillyFDC.BBY<br />Packed.Generic.236&nbsp;<br />W32.Troresba</p>
<p>Due to its replication nature it takes a lot of space in the hard drive and consumes more CPU uses which in turn makes the pc too slow also consumes more network bandwidth.</p>
<strong>Following are different type of VirusFile Virus:</strong>This type of virus normally infects program files such as .exe, .com, .bat. Once this virus stays in memory it tries to infect all programs that load on to memory.</div>

<p><strong>Macro Virus:&nbsp;</strong>These type of virus infects word, excel, PowerPoint, access and other data files. Once infected repairing of these files is very much difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Master boot record files:&nbsp;</strong>MBR viruses are memory-resident viruses and copy itself to the first sector of a storage device which is used for partition tables or OS loading programs .A MBR virus will infect this particular area of Storage device instead of normal files. The easiest way to remove a MBR virus is to clean the MBR area,</p>
<p><strong>Boot sector virus:&nbsp;</strong>Boot sector virus infects the boot sector of a HDD or FDD. These are also memory resident in nature. As soon as the computer starts it gets infected from the boot sector. &nbsp;Cleaning this type of virus is very difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Multipartite virus:&nbsp;</strong>A hybrid of Boot and Program/file viruses. They infect program files and when the infected program is executed, these viruses infect the boot record. When you boot the computer next time the virus from the boot record loads in memory and then start infecting other program files on disk</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphic viruses:&nbsp;</strong>A virus that can encrypt its code in different ways so that it appears differently in each infection. These viruses are more difficult to detect.</p>
<p><strong>Stealth viruses:&nbsp;</strong>These types of viruses use different kind of techniques to avoid detection. They either redirect the disk head to read another sector instead of the one in which they reside or they may alter the reading of the infected file&rsquo;s size shown in the directory listing. For example, the Whale virus adds 9216 bytes to an infected file; then the virus subtracts the same number of bytes (9216) from the size given in the directory.</p>

<p>- Software and hardware to protect networks</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of network security hardware, software, and methods that can be combined to protect sensitive data against external attacks and insider threats.</p>
<p>This article outlines network security core principles and the most popular technologies used by cybersecurity professionals to reduce network vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>What is Network Security?</h2>
<p><a href="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/what-is-network-security" target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;" rel="noopener">Network security</a>&nbsp;is any practice or tool designed and implemented to secure a network and its data. It includes software, hardware, and cloud solutions. Effective network security tools stop a wide range of cyberattacks, and prevent attacks spreading throughout the network in case of a data breach.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s cyber environment, every organization must implement network security processes and solutions to maintain the uptime of their online resources. All network security solutions are implemented in accordance with the core principles of network security.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Principles of Network Security</h2>
<h3>The CIA Triad</h3>
<p>The CIA triad consists of three core principles that work together to ensure network security. Any network <a href="https://cubesolve.com/">security solution can</a> be categorized as supporting one of the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confidentiality:&nbsp;Data is kept protected against threats and unauthorized access.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>:&nbsp;Data is kept accurate and trustworthy by preventing accidental or intentional alterations or deletion.</li>
<li><strong>Availability</strong>:&nbsp;Data is kept accessible to those who are authorized to have access.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Network Security Components</h3>
<p>To deter cyberattacks and <a href="https://geekprank.com/hacker/" rel="nofollow">hacking attempts</a>, a total of three types of network security components can be called upon &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>hardware</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>software</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>cloud</strong>&nbsp;security components.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware components</strong>&nbsp;include servers and devices that perform an array of security operations within a network. Hardware components can be set up in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Out of the path of network traffic (&ldquo;out-of-line&rdquo;):</strong>&nbsp;Operating as a separate entity from network traffic, out-of-line security appliances are tasked with monitoring traffic and raising alerts when they detect malicious data.</li>
<li><strong>In the path of network traffic (&ldquo;in-line&rdquo;):</strong>&nbsp;A more popular option of the two, in-line hardware appliances are tasked with directly blocking data packets the moment they run into potential threats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security&nbsp;<strong>software components</strong>&nbsp;are installed on devices across the network, providing added detection capabilities and threat remediation. The far most common form of software network security components are antivirus applications.</p>
<p>Finally,&nbsp;<a href="https://phoenixnap.com/cloud-services">cloud services</a>&nbsp;entail offloading the security infrastructure onto a cloud provider. The protection strategy is similar to in-line hardware appliances as all the network traffic goes through the cloud provider. While there, the traffic gets scanned for potential threats before either being blocked or allowed into the network.</p>
<p>Sound networks usually rely on a combination of several security components working at once. This kind of a multi-layered defense system ensures that even if a threat manages to slip through the cracks of one component, another layer of protection will keep it from gaining access to the network.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-78195 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/data-security-cloud-layers-of-security.png" sizes="(max-width: 833px) 100vw, 833px" srcset="https://phoenixnap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/data-security-cloud-layers-of-security.png 833w, https://phoenixnap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/data-security-cloud-layers-of-security-207x300.png 207w, https://phoenixnap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/data-security-cloud-layers-of-security-768x1113.png 768w, https://phoenixnap.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/data-security-cloud-layers-of-security-707x1024.png 707w" alt="Understanding Layered security and different principles of network security" width="833" height="1207" data-ll-status="loaded" /></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To truly protect a network, multiple specialized hardware and software need to be installed and managed. By implementing a layered network security approach with tools that support the principles of the CIA triad, a network can be secured against a wide array of vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>- Network protocols: SSL, HTTPS, IPv6</p>

<h2 class="learning-content-h2 learning-content-h2--margin-top-16px">What is SSL?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, and it refers to a protocol for encrypting and securing communications that take place on the Internet. Although SSL was replaced by an updated protocol called TLS (Transpor Layer Security) some time ago, "SSL" is still a commonly used term for this technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main use case for SSL/TLS is securing communications between a client and a server, but it can also secure email, VoIP, and other communications over unsecured networks.</p>
<h2 class="learning-content-h2">How does SSL/TLS work?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the essential principles to grasp for understanding how SSL/TLS works:</p>
<ul class="learning-list" style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Secure communication begins with a TLS handshake,&nbsp;in which the two communicating parties open a secure connection and exchange the public key</li>
<li>During the TLS handshake, the two parties generate session keys, and the session keys encrypt and decrypt all communications after the TLS handshake</li>
<li>Different session keys are used to encrypt communications in each new session</li>
<li>TLS ensures that the party on the server side, or the website the user is interacting with, is actually who they claim to be</li>
<li>TLS also ensures that data has not been altered, since a message authentication code (MAC) is included with transmissions</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With TLS, both HTTP&nbsp;data that users send to a website (by clicking, filling out forms, etc.) and the HTTP data that websites send to users is encrypted. Encrypted data has to be decrypted by the recipient using a key.</p>

<h1>What is HTTPS?</h1>
<p>(<strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>ransfer&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rotocol) The communications protocol used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network (intranet). The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser. It is also used to download data from the server either to the browser or to any requesting application that uses HTTP.<br /><br />Addresses of websites begin with an&nbsp;<strong>http://</strong>&nbsp;prefix; however, Web browsers typically default to the HTTP protocol. For example, typing&nbsp;<strong>www.yahoo.com</strong>&nbsp;is the same as typing&nbsp;<strong>http://www.yahoo.com</strong>. In fact, only&nbsp;<strong>yahoo.com</strong>&nbsp;has to be typed in. The browser adds the rest.<br /><br /><br /><strong>HTTPS</strong> (HTTP Secure) is the encrypted version of HTTP.<br /><br /><strong>A Stateless Connection</strong><br />HTTP is a "stateless" request/response system. The connection is maintained between client and server only for the immediate request, and the connection is closed. After the HTTP client establishes a TCP connection with the server and sends it a request command, the server sends back its response and closes the connection.<br /><br />The first version of HTTP caused considerable overhead. Each time a graphics file on the page was requested, a new protocol connection had to be established between the browser and the server. In HTTP Version 1.1, multiple files could be downloaded with the same connection. It also improved caching and made it easier to create virtual hosts (multiple websites on the same server).&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><img class="mx-auto" src="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/encyclopedia-terms/http-webserv.fit_lim.size_1000x.gif" alt="webserv.gif" data-image-loader="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/encyclopedia-terms/http-webserv.gif" data-lazy-sized="" data-viewed="true" /><br /><br /></p>
<div class="font-bold text-lg text-center"><strong>Web Server Fundamentals</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="text-center font-bold">Web browsers communicate with Web servers via the TCP/IP protocol. The browser sends HTTP requests to the server, which responds by sending back headers (messages) and files (HTML pages, image files, Java applets, etc.).&nbsp;</div>

<h1>&nbsp;What is IPv6?</h1>
<p>The creation of IPv6, and its slow replacement of IPv4, has been a huge and critical innovation for the future of internet communications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary function of IPv6 is to allow for more unique TCP/IP address identifiers to be created, now that we&rsquo;ve run out of the 4.3 billion created with IPv4. This is one of the main reasons why IPv6 is such an important innovation for the Internet of Things (IoT). Internet-connected products are becoming increasingly popular, and while IPv4 addresses couldn&rsquo;t meet the demand for IoT products, IPv6 gives IoT products a platform to operate on for a very long time.</p>
<p>There are dozens of reasons why IPv6 is superior to IPv4 (and why this new internet protocol is important for companies to understand), but we&rsquo;re zeroing in on IPv6 for IoT. Let&rsquo;s take a look at three of the distinct advantages it offers.</p>
<h2>3 Reasons Why IPv6 Is Important For the Internet Of Things</h2>
<h3>1. SECURITY</h3>
<p>With billions of new smart products being created every day, security is an important thought in the back of all IoT engineer's minds. Organizations and individuals have learned of the real and imminent threat that hackers pose in past years, but the IoT brings up a whole new line of security intricacies. Hacking a secure network and harvesting millions of credit card numbers is terrible&mdash;but if someone with ill intentions was to <a href="https://geekprank.com/hacker/">hack</a> a smart city, or a neighborhood of smart houses, the outcome could be far more catastrophic. You can tell why IoT security is very important&mdash;and the good news is that IPv6 offers better security solutions than its predecessor, largely due to IPSec.</p>
<p>For one thing, IPv6 can run end-to-end encryption. While this technology was retrofitted into IPv4, it remains an extra option that is not universally used. The encryption and integrity-checking used in current virtual private networks (VPNs) are a standard component in IPv6, available for all connections and supported by all compatible devices and systems. Widespread adoption of IPv6 will therefore make &ldquo;man-in-the-middle&rdquo; attacks&mdash;i.e., thinking that you&rsquo;re signing into a secure bank log in when you&rsquo;re actually walking into a cyber &ldquo;trap&rdquo;&mdash;significantly more difficult.</p>
<p>IPv6 also supports more-secure name resolution. The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) protocol is capable of enabling cryptographic confirmation that a host is who it claims to be at the time of the connection. This renders Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning and other naming-based attacks more difficult. And while IPv6 isn&rsquo;t a replacement for application- or service-layer verification, it still offers an improved level of trust in connections. With IPv4, it&rsquo;s fairly easy for an attacker to redirect traffic between two legitimate hosts and manipulate the conversation or at least observe it&mdash;but IPv6 makes this very difficult.</p>
<p>These added security features depend entirely on proper design and implementation of IPv6, and the more complex, flexible infrastructure of IPv6 makes this process more difficult. Nevertheless, if properly configured, IPv6 networking will be significantly more secure than IPv4 by a longshot.</p>
<h3>2. SCALABILITY</h3>
<p>According to a report put out by Gartner, 25 billion &ldquo;things&rdquo; will be connected to the internet by the year 2020. That&rsquo;s a pretty incredible estimation, considering the same report notes that 4.9 billion devices will be connected in 2015. This purported 400% increase in growth in only five years sheds some light on how much exponential IoT growth we can expect to see in the next 10, 20, or even 50 years.</p>
<p>Given these numbers, it&rsquo;s easy to understand why IPv6 (and its trillions upon trillions of new addresses) are important for IoT devices. Creators of IoT products that are connected over TCP/IP can rest assured that there will be a unique identifier available for their devices for a long, long time.</p>
<h3>3. CONNECTABILITY</h3>
<p>With billions of new IoT devices entering the market each year, connectability&mdash;i.e., allowing network-connected devices to &ldquo;speak&rdquo; to each other&mdash;is vital.</p>
<p>With IPv4, there were quite a few issues with allowing IoT products to speak with one another. Network Address Translation (NAT) posed one of these major issues. NAT was created as a workaround for organizations who needed multiple people and devices to be able to work off of the same IPv4 address. Not only does this pose a security issue (which we&rsquo;ll talk about in a moment), but it also poses a difficult issue for IoT products. IPv6 allows IoT products to be uniquely addressable without having to work around all of the traditional NAT and firewall issues. Larger and more advanced host devices have all sorts of tools to make working with firewalls and NAT routers easier, but small IoT endpoints do not. By using IPv6, many of these issues become easier for TCP/IP enabled IoT devices to handle.</p>
<h2>Is IPv6 A Perfect IoT Solution?</h2>
<p>While IPv6 is an excellent and necessary upgrade from IPv4, it&rsquo;s certainly not an be all, end all solution&nbsp;for the IoT.</p>
<p>One challenge that companies face is determining how to get IPv4 and IPv6 devices to communicate properly. The foundation of the internet has been laid with IPv4 addresses, but what happens when internet service providers (ISPs) stop supporting IPv4 (or don&rsquo;t yet support IPv6)?</p>
<p>An even more pressing challenge is that not all IoT products are directly connected to the internet using TCP/IP. Some need very slim packet headers to maximize payload allocations in very small datagrams. For example, if you are limited to sending only 20 numbers at a time, and 18 are needed just for addressing, you don&rsquo;t have much room left for useful information. This means that long-range messages need as little of the message to be used for addressing as possible. When this is the case, IPv6 isn&rsquo;t a interesting idea because it has too much overhead.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>IPv6 is a great and important update to an outdated Internet Protocol. But, it&rsquo;s not a perfect solution, and it doesn&rsquo;t fix every challenge with the IoT. We will talk more about the issues with IPv6 when applied to low power, low data rate systems in our next IPv6 article.</p>

<p>The digital certificate serves two purposes: it verifies the owner's identity and it makes the owner's public key available. It is issued with an expiration date, after which it is no longer guaranteed by the certificate authority (CA).</p>
<p>To obtain a digital certificate, you send a request to the CA of your choice, such as Verisign, or RSA. The request includes your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature. A distinguished name (DN) is a unique identifier for each user or host for which you are applying for a certificate. The CA checks your signature using your public key and performs some level of verification of your identity (this varies with different CAs). After verification, the CA sends you a signed digital certificate that contains your distinguished name, your public key, the CA's distinguished name, and the signature of the certificate authority. You store this signed certificate in your key database.</p>
<div class="p">When you send this certificate to a receiver, the receiver performs two steps to verify your identity:
<ol class="bx--list--ordered--temporary">
<li class="bx--list__item">Uses your public key that comes with the certificate to check your digital signature.</li>
<li class="bx--list__item">Verifies that the CA that issued your certificate is legitimate and trustworthy. To do this, the receiver needs the public key of the CA. The receiver might already hold an assured copy of the public key of the CA in their key database, but if not, the receiver must acquire an additional digital certificate to obtain the public key of the CA. This certificate might in turn depend on the digital certificate of another CA; there might be a hierarchy of certificates issued by multiple CAs, each depending on the validity of the next. Eventually, however, the receiver needs the public key of the&nbsp;<dfn class="term">root CA</dfn>. The root CA is the CA at the top of the hierarchy. To trust the validity of the digital certificate of the root CA, the public-key user must receive that digital certificate in a secure manner, such as through a download from an authenticated server, or with preloaded software received from a reliable source, or on a securely delivered diskette.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Many applications that send a digital certificate to a receiver send not just their own certificate, but also all of the CA digital certificates necessary to verify the hierarchy of certificates up to the root CA certificate.</p>
<p>For a digital certificate to be entirely trustworthy, the owner of the digital certificate must have carefully protected their private key, for example, by encrypting it on their computer's hard drive. If their private key has been compromised, an imposter could misuse their digital certificate.</p>
<p>You can use self-signed digital certificates for testing purposes. A self-signed digital certificate contains your distinguished name, your public key, and your signature.</p>
